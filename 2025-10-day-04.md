## ðŸªž Reflection
Today I ran a Servio test and arranged official testing for next week. I kept energy up with a gym session and 30 minutes of cardio. I didn't read today, but the technical progress and fitness felt productive.

**Tomorrowâ€™s Must-Win:**
Prepare test checklist for official Servio testing and get at least 1h of focused work.
