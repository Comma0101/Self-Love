# 🌱 Self-Love Points Guide

A simple open-source framework to **turn self-love into measurable proof**.  
Not affirmations, not vibes — just daily evidence that you respect yourself.

## 🔑 What Is Self-Love?

Self-love is **self-respect in practice**.  
It’s not indulgence or ego — it’s the daily act of:

- Keeping promises to yourself.  
- Protecting your time, energy, and boundaries.  
- Making choices aligned with your values and future.  

👉 Confidence comes not from words, but from *proof*:  
**Action → Evidence → Belief.**

## 🎯 The Self-Love Points System

**Scoring each day:**

- **2 points** → Fully honored promise.  
- **1 point** → Partial effort / compromised but attempted.  
- **0 points** → Skipped / neglected.  

**Method:**

- Review the 5 domains below.  
- Record a score (0–2) for each.  
- Add quick notes for actions that earned the points.  
- Track daily / weekly / monthly totals.  

---

## 🪨 The Five Domains

1. **Creation & Work** – building, shipping, pursuing projects.  
2. **Body & Energy** – gym, running, sleep, nutrition, recovery.  
3. **Finance & Discipline** – budgeting, trading by plan, disciplined work.  
4. **Growth & Mind** – reading, journaling, studying, learning new skills.  
5. **Boundaries & Integrity** – saying no, avoiding distractions, keeping commitments.  

---

## 📈 Why Track Points?

- **Build self-trust** – every point = evidence you kept your word.  
- **See patterns** – find which domains collapse under stress.  
- **Shift mindset** – from guilt/shame → respect/ownership.  
- **Motivate consistency** – small deposits compound into identity.  

---

## 🧭 How to Use

**Daily (2–3 min):**  
- Score each domain (0–2).  
- Write: *“Today I showed myself love by…”*  
- Pick tomorrow’s must-win.  

**Weekly (10–15 min):**  
- Add up total points.  
- Spot weakest domain.  
- Adjust tactics (simplify, reframe, redesign).  

**Monthly:**  
- Max = `days × 10`.  
- **>180 pts** → strong baseline.  
- **120–180 pts** → inconsistent, refine.  
- **<120 pts** → system too heavy → simplify.
