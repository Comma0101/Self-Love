# 🌱 Self-Love Points Guide (Redesigned)

## 🔑 What Is Self-Love?

Self-love is **self-respect in practice**.
It’s not indulgence or ego. It’s the daily act of:

* Keeping promises to yourself.
* Protecting your time, energy, and boundaries.
* Making choices aligned with your values and future.

Self-love = *evidence that you can trust yourself*.
Confidence comes not from affirmations, but from proof: action → evidence → belief.

## 🎯 The Self-Love Points System

**Purpose:** Turn self-love into measurable proof.

**Scoring:**

* **2 points** → Fully honored promise in this domain.
* **1 point** → Partial effort / compromised but attempted.
* **0 points** → Skipped / neglected.

**Method:**

* Each day, review the 5 domains below.
* Record a score (0–2) for each.
* Add notes for specific actions that earned the points.
* Weekly/monthly reviews show growth, consistency, and weak spots.

## 🪨 The Five Domains of Self-Love

1. **Creation & Work**

  * Building, shipping, or pursuing meaningful projects.
  * Examples: Servio deep work, Upwork proposals, portfolio building, coding, creative output.

2. **Body & Energy**

  * Caring for your physical vessel.
  * Examples: gym, running, stretching, nutrition, sleep, rest when needed.

3. **Finance & Discipline**

  * Honoring money and discipline systems.
  * Examples: trading by plan, running Uber shifts, budgeting, avoiding reckless spending.

4. **Growth & Mind**

  * Expanding your knowledge and perspective.
  * Examples: reading, studying, journaling, courses, learning new skills.

5. **Boundaries & Integrity**

  * Protecting your structure and saying no to what undermines you.
  * Examples: no doomscrolling, resisting porn, keeping commitments, finishing what you start.

## 📈 Why Track Points?

* **Builds self-trust** → every point is evidence you kept your word.
* **Shifts mindset** → from guilt/shame to respect/ownership.
* **Reveals patterns** → highlights which domains are strong, which collapse under stress.
* **Motivates consistency** → small deposits compound into identity.

## 🧭 How to Use This Guide

1. **Daily (2–3 min)**

  * Score each domain (0–2).
  * Write a short reflection: *“Today I showed myself love by…”*.
  * Choose tomorrow’s must-win.

2. **Weekly (10–15 min)**

  * Add up total points.
  * Spot your weakest domain.
  * Adjust tactics (simplify, reframe, redesign).

3. **Monthly Review**

  * Calculate total possible points (10 × days).
  * **>180 points** → strong self-trust baseline.
  * **120–180 points** → growing, but inconsistent → refine domains.
  * **<120 points** → system too heavy or self-negotiation too high → simplify.

## 🧭 Closing Reminder

Self-love isn’t a mood.
It’s the **proof you give yourself each day**:

* Evidence of effort.
* Boundaries honored.
* Promises kept.

Return to this guide anytime you drift. It is both your **reset button** and your **mirror of growth**.

⚡ Now this system can flex: one day “Upwork proposal” counts as Creation & Work, another day “Uber shift” counts as Finance & Discipline. Nothing is boxed in — everything feeds back to *self-respect*.
