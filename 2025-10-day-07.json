  "reflection": "Today I focused on testing and learning. I ran a Servio test with a partner and will set a date with the POS company manager. I did a chest session at the gym in the morning. I intentionally didn't focus on live trading this morning and placed no trades. Instead I studied day trading with quant data and option flow, and read the Tao Te Ching for about 30 minutes — the day felt balanced between work, learning, and recovery.",
