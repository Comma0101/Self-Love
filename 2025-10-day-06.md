## ðŸªž Reflection
Today I did a short 30-minute Servio session. I skipped the gym and reading. The standout win was trading: I captured a large profit on AMD (~$3,000+), the biggest profit I've had so far. Most importantly, I followed my plan and didn't overtrade after the win.

**Tomorrowâ€™s Must-Win:**
Respect the gainâ€”no revenge trades, review the trade to learn, and do 1 hour of focused Servio.
