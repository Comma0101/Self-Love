## ðŸªž Reflection
Today I showed myself love by putting in focused work: 1 hour of Servio and 1 hour improving my portfolio. I did an arm day at the gym and took a 30-minute Uber shift. I placed a SPY trade that lost, but I followed my plan and stopped â€” no chasing. That discipline felt like a win.

**Tomorrowâ€™s Must-Win:**
No trades (weekend). Prioritize earning time: schedule extra Uber shifts (aim for 2 hours). Continue Servio deep work (1.5h) but protect trading for Monday.
